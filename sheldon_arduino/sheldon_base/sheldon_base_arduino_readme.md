# Arduino for Sheldon Base

## This Arduino does the following:
- reads/publishes ODOM from wheel encoders
- reads/publishes waist position from waist position encoder
- gets user commands for the robot from Android phone via bluetooth, and publishes to ROS
see the "BotControl" project to build the Android phone part of the solution.


1. Make sure you configure Arduino as follows:

File-> Preferences -> Sketchbook location: C:\Dev\Arduino

2.  Set COM Port to port where Arduino is connected

3.  Pair Phone with BlueSmirf module.

4.  In Android "BotControl" project, set DEVICE_ADDRESS to device address
    To find device address, pair bluetooth device with a PC, then check
    properties of the driver in device manager. (Details -> Hardware Ids)
    Hint: If you see "Firefly ABCD" the <ABCD> is the last two digits of
    the device; eg. 00:06:66:1F:AB:CD

## TO SETUP A NEW DEVICE:
1.  On the Android phone, install Amarino!  
    From command line:  "adb install Amarino_2_xxx.apk"
2.  Run Amarino and add BT devices!
(if you skip these steps, the App will never connect)




If you get this error (or similar):
	In file included from RobotArduino.ino:3:
	RobotConstants.h:37: error: 'byte' does not name a type
	RobotUtilities:216: error: 'struct ARDUINO_CMD_T' has no member named 'Param4'

You need to set the Sketchbook location above, exit and restart Arduino IDE!
